Next Steps with Project

PEAD
- Strategy: go long or short stock after reportDate for earnings based on earnings suprise. Go long if
beat short if miss. Targets stocks that might be under the radar and still have alpha for this strategy 
- Test: Need to backtest to find optimal length of holding as well as well optimal earnings miss and beat 
percentage
- Stage: Data is collected and cleaned and mostly visualized (earnings drift is not)

Momentum
- Strategy: go long or short based on momentum. Go long when momentum is above a certain threshold and
short when below. Focused on large cap tech stocks as they are the most seen by the public and discussed
on forums so their momentum influences recreational traders more than other stocks
- Test: Need to backtest to find optimal momentum threshold and hodling period 
- Stage: Data is collected for the stocks and the momentum and cleaned and visualized. Ready for further
development and testing of strategy

Bitcoin
- Strategy: go long or short bitcoin based on sentiment analysis. Long when sentiment is very negative 
and short when sentiment is very positive. This is because over the past few years I have noticed that 
positive sentiment online and in the news is much more prevelant as bitcoin is increasing in price. Follows
the idea of if you hear your barber giving stocks advice its time to sell. The reverse works as well as
bitcoin tends to dry up in the news when it plateaus in price. Looking at the bitcoin price graph there 
is rarely any sustained highs so the plateau is usually at local minimums. 
- Test: Need to backtest using the price of bitcoin and sentiment data to see what sentiment score and 
holding time is optimal
- Stage: price data is collected, cleaned, and visualized. The sentiment data needs work. At the moment it
is just a collection of all overall sentiment scores. I need to add the date of the article to the sentiment
scores.
